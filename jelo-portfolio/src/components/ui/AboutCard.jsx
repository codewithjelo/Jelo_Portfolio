        I am Jann Angelo C. Dimaano, 22 years old, from Batangas City. I am a
        fresh graduate from Batangas State University and took BS Information
        Technology, Major in Business Analytics (Batch 2025). My interest in web
        development began when I entered college, starting with vanilla HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript while building front-end projects.

      <p className="about-desc leading-relaxed text-justify indent-8 px-4">
        Through university projects and freelancing experience, I have created
        front-end websites, designed user interfaces, and developed fully
        functional websites while collaborating in teams. This hands-on
        experience, combined with my academic background, has helped me grow
        into a more capable web developer.
